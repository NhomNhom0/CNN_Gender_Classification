# ðŸšº/ðŸš¹ CNN_Gender_Classification
This mini-project utilizes the pre-trained EfficientNetB3 model to construct a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for gender recognition through images.

# ðŸš€ How to run 
Import notebook file gender-classification.ipynb to run on kaggle.com because the training process will be very time consuming and resource consuming. So training on cloud is recommended. After training you can download the model from output to run ./predict/predict.ipynb file on local.
